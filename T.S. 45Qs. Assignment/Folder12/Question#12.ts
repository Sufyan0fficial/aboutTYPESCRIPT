//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let name: string[] = ["AbuBakr", "Ahmad Fareedi", "Abraiz"];
console.log(`Hello, ${name[0]}, hopes you are doing well.`);
console.log(`Hello, ${name[1]}, hopes you are doing well.`);
console.log(`Hello, ${name[2]}, hopes you are doing well.`);
